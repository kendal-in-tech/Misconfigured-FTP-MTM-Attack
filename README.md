In this Lab we will discuss FTP, and why and how to use SFTP to secure your FTP communications. We will also perform a MTM Attack, and attempt to access files using the Client PC's login credentials.

What is FTP?

FTP, short for File Transfer Protocol, is like a method for moving files from one computer to another over the internet. Imagine you have a file cabinet in one office (your computer) and you need to send files to a cabinet in another office (another computer, usually a server that stores a lot of data). FTP is one of the ways you can do that.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

Two Computers: You have your computer and another computer you want to send files to or get files from.
Connection: Both computers need to be connected to the internet and set up to talk to each other using this method.
Sending and Receiving: You can either send files to the other computer or receive files from it.
Even though there are newer ways to send files using the internet, FTP is still used especially in situations where a lot of files are moved regularly, like in banks or when downloading software from the internet using a web browser.
